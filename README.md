# 🐍 Python Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Python Mini Projects** repository!  
This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate level Python projects that I've built while learning and practicing Python programming. Each project is standalone and focuses on implementing different programming concepts and logic.

## 🚀 Projects Included

Here is a list of Python projects included in this repository:

1. 🕰️ **Alarm Clock**  
   A simple alarm clock using Python's `datetime` and `time` modules to alert the user at a specific time.

2. 🎲 **Dice Art**  
   A fun CLI-based dice simulator that displays random ASCII art for each dice roll.

3. 🔐 **Encryption & Decryption**  
   A basic implementation of text encryption and decryption using Caesar Cipher or similar encoding techniques.

4. 🏦 **Python Banking System**  
   A simple terminal-based banking system that allows users to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and create accounts.

5. 🍿 **Concession Stand Program**  
   A program that simulates a snack counter allowing users to select items and calculates the total bill.

6. ❓ **Quiz Game**  
   A multiple-choice quiz game where the player answers questions and receives a score at the end.

7. 🎲 **Random Number Generator**  
   Generates a random number within a specified range, useful for simple games or simulations.

8. ✊ 🖐 ✌️ **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   The classic game against the computer with score tracking and random outcomes.

9. 🧙‍♂️ **Adventure Game**  
   A text-based interactive game where the player navigates through different scenarios and makes choices that impact the outcome.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Libraries (`random`, `time`, `datetime`, etc.)
- CLI/Terminal Input-Output

## 📘 What You'll Learn

By going through or building these projects, you'll improve your understanding of:

- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and modular coding
- User input and output handling
- Randomization techniques
- Basic file handling (in some projects)
- Simulating real-world scenarios in code
- Error handling and basic debugging
